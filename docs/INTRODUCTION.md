# Introduction

## What is Tron?
Tron (TRX) is a blockchain platform launched as the foundation for a decentralized entertainment ecosystem. Created by controversial figure Justin Sun, Tron focuses on expanding the market of decentralized digital content applications by making it easier to create and deploy them. The Tron mainnet launched Jun 2018, and it since expanded to become a blockchain-based OS. the Tronix TRX is the proprietary cryptocurrency token of the Tron blockchain.
  
Adoption of blockchain technology is limited in part because of the difficulty many developers face in learning to build from scratch on entirely new protocols. Tron is designed to ease this transition and therefore hasten the decentralization of existing platforms and creation of new dApps.

## What is TNS?
TNS is the Tron Name Service, a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Tron blockchain.  
TNS is to map human-readable names like `portal.trx` to machine-readable identifiers such as Tron addresses, content hashes, and metadata.

TNS has similar goals to DNS, the Internetâ€™s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture, due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Tron blockchain. Like DNS, TNS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchial names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over the allocation of subdomains.

Top-level domains, like `.trx` are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a second-level domain for their own use.

## Why we need TNS?
Blockchain addresses are not friendly enough to humans, the hash addresses are too long, hard to remember, and not easy to identify which is correct or incorrect.  

The blockchain now becomes more and more popular, the shortcomings of address transfer will become more and more obvious. Just as we are sending emails today, it is difficult to use a 32-bit string as an email account. Therefore, an alias service is very helpful for the ease of use of the blockchain system. For example, IPFS has an alias service called InterPlanetary Name Service (IPNS), and Ethereum has its own domain name service called Ethereum Name Service (ENS). We do think that Tron system should also have its own alias service.

## The Expandability of TNS
What kind of resource an alias should point to is flexible and can be implemented just by implementing the corresponding TNS resolvers. In addition to pointing to an address, it can also point to a contract address, thus enabling interaction through TNS and smart contracts.
